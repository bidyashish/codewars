### Getting Started

In order to the following example 

just run eg: 
```
node triplets-array-given-sum.js
```
---
> Given an array and a value, find if there is a triplet in array whose sum is equal to the given value. If there is such a triplet present in array, then print the triplet and return true. Else return false

check [triplets-array-given-sum.js](/triplets-array-given-sum.js).
```
arr=[1, 4, 45, 6, 10, 8]

sum=22

find array[a,b,c]  where a+b+c = sum

eg: From above array 4+10+8 =22
so Answers is [4,10,8]
```

> Given an array and a value, find if there is a pairs in array whose sum is equal to the given value. If there is such a pairs present in array, then print the pairs and return true. Else return false

check [pair-array-given-sum.js](/pair-array-given-sum.js).
```
arr=[1, 4, 45, 6, 10, 8]

sum=7

find array[a,b]  where a+b = sum

eg: From above array 1+6 = 7
so Answers is [1,6]
```

> The maximum sum subarray problem consists in finding the maximum sum of a contiguous subsequence in an array or list of integers:

Easy case is when the list is made up of only positive numbers and the maximum sum is the sum of the whole array. If the list is made up of only negative numbers, return 0 instead.

Empty list is considered to have zero greatest sum. Note that the empty list or array is also a valid sublist/subarray.

check [continous-subsequence.js](/continous-subsequence.js).
```

maxSequence([1, 2, 3, 4]

output: 10
```

> Javascript Implementation of Longest Common Subsequence

Find longest common subsequence between two strings

check [longest-common-subsequence.js](/longest-common-subsequence.js).
```
String1 = AGGTAB
String2 = GXTXAYB

Result array conatining LCS is G,T,A,B
Length of result array 4
Result string GTAB

```
